THIS AND THE GAME FOLDERS ARE EXAMPLES ON HOW TO USE THE LIBRARY
GREENTEA IS THE FOLDER CONTAINING THE ACTUAL MAP LIBRARY.


Namespacing:
All classes that are used have the gt_ prefix in front of it.
gt_widget=widgets
gt_tileset=tileset
gt_tile=tile
gt_map=map
gt_layer=layer
gt_camera=camera
etc, etc.

A quick note on the directory structure of the GreenTea map library.

The Core folder contains all the core routines/functions/tables/etc. It's probably best not
to edit these (as we say in the biz- NEVER HACK CORE!).  

The Plugins folder:
This folder (and sub folders) contain plugins that can be used
to extend the functionality of greentea. These are not core per se, though
the files in the editor directory (plugins/editor, etc) are pretty much core.

Sub folder of Plugins:
Editor: 
This contains folders that are basically the toolbars that appear. Each file inside of the folder is a diferent Widget, or tool. You can add to these by creating a file in
the folder, and in it extend from the gt_widget class. The assets directory are all the basic editor assets, including buttons and the mouse graphic.

Formats:
This will contain files for each file format that can be used. Each file has a class in it that extends the gt_file_format class

Layers:
This contains files that are layer types. To use this when creating a new layer, specify as it's type as the filename without the .lua ext. An example
is in this directory, the parallax plugin. This is a constantly scrolling layer, always moving a direction for X amount.

Objects:
In game/In Map objects. These inherit from the gt_object type. There is an example in here.

Templates:
These are map templates that can be used to structure your game map in a certain way, so that
they all use similar layers/etc.  This can be speed up game editing. You can have a lot of
different templates that can be very handy. Ones for caves, for overworld, etc.

There is an example template in the directory.

The basic layout for a plugin is:
a file, put inside of the directory you want to use it in.
A class object that is local to the file.
This class object must inherit from the object you wish to use the plugin for.
For example, a template plugin would:

local example_template=Class{}
example_template:include(gt_template)

This is how a HUMP class extends/inherits a base class.

Then, you can over-ride all the function you want to/need to. Any time you don't specify a function, it uses
the base class's function. This allows you to only specify what you want or need to change.

then, at the end of the file you need to return the local class you created (return example_template)


Anyone that has used Symfony 2 framework can see it's influence in the plugin framework.

--you need to require greentea, and it returns a greentea object.
--greentea is the name of the folder where the library is.
--But, it does use relative directories
--So you can rename it, or place it in a sub folder like libraries
--or something. Just make sure you "require" it using the right directory.

--This is for the scaling. I like a retro look.

	-- changes you need. You pass a table with the correct
	-- information and it knows what to do.

											image="game/maps/ground.png", 	--the image we plan on using.
											tile_height=16, 				--our tile height
											tile_width=16,					--our tile width.			
											--another thing of note- the base tileset can be over-ridden per layer.
											--the example template, every single layer has it's own tileset
											--so the map one will probably not be used. It needs to be put in though
