{"name":"Greentea","tagline":"A map editor built around Lua and Love2d.","body":"### Welcome to Greentea: The pure Lua/Love2d Mapeditor/loader/player\r\nThis is a mapeditor/loader/player written entirely in Love2d and Lua. It allows users to edit maps in the Love2d environment and save them, as well as load them and play them with ease. Right now the editor is a WIP, but will eventually allow people to call a mapeditor inside of their game while playing it.  Since Greentea uses a powerful plugin methodology for extending it, you can actually edit more than just maps inside the editor. You can edit objects on the map in real time as well, all based around how you want the program to run.\r\n\r\n### Greentea: The Library\r\nThe git hub is the folder for the main library. This can be placed within your project, and then loaded with a simple:\r\ngreantea=require(\"greentea\")\r\n\r\nYou can also put it in sub folders, so if you have a folder for libraries, you can put it in there, and it will automatically know where all the files are. Just remember to include the sub-folders when calling \"require\".\r\n\r\nRight now the mapengine uses TSerial for saving/loading maps and HUMP's Class system for allowing OOP in the way I think makes sense for the project. These files are included in the requisite directory, but I did not program either of these.\r\n\r\n### A Basic Example\r\nHere is a basic example for main.lua:\r\n\r\n--you need to require greentea, and it returns a greentea object.\r\ngreentea=require(\"greentea\")\r\n\r\nlove.graphics.setDefaultImageFilter(\"nearest\", \"nearest\")\r\n\r\nfunction love.load()\r\n\tgreentea:set_file_directory(\"game/maps\")\r\n\tgreentea:set_scale(2, 2)\r\n\tgreentea:load(\"test.gtmap\")\r\nend\r\n\r\nfunction love.update(dt)\r\n\t--always need this--\r\n\tgreentea:update(dt)\r\nend\r\n\r\nfunction love.draw()\r\n\tgreentea:draw()\r\nend\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's that easy! Here is that some example, packaged into a .love file:\r\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/635941/greentea.love\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
